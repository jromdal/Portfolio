## About Me

Passionate about the intersection of biology and data science, I am a graduate student at Arizona State University completing my Master's in Biological Data Science. Having previously earned a Bachelor's in Biological Sciences from ASU, I bring a strong foundation in both biology and statistics to my current academic pursuits. I'm excited to continue bridging the gap between biology and data science, and am open to opportunities for collaboration and exploration in the ever-evolving field of biological data science.
